This is an android app, which you'll ever need to read News. It is loaded with many unique features which you'd love to use. But before we dive into features, let's know why another news reading app ? You see, most of the news reading apps, like TOI or The Hindu, you'd be able to see the newses from their sources only. Similarly, using apps like inshorts, gives you a summary of articles which are recommended for you. This is okay for the most part, but none of these apps, help us make better descisions and mitigate the bias. Almost all of the news apps, available out there are solely for the purpose of showing you the latest news. However, this is not the case with *Samachaar*. This app is made for the users to read the best news and make intellectual opinions, since due to the incompetency of the Indian media, making sound decisions and forming intellect opinions seems too far.
This is an android app which will not only help you read news articles, but would also help you mitigate the bias of newses (*i.e. if this news article is biased towards any particular subject or not ? Think of it as Arnab being biased towards Modiji*). So this app would mitigate the bias and tell you wether the news article is biased or not ? What is the sentiment of the news, it is positive , negative or neutral. It will also figure out the emotion of the news article. It automatically figures out the most relevant topics and extracts the most relevant keywords and shows you the news based on the topics. You can also listen to news article on the go, just like an e-book or podcast. And there's much more to the app. Please refer to the features section to know more. *This is an open source project aims to propogate the latest news to the public all while giving the ability to make better and sound decisions*.
